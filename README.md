Maybe you've seen this puzzle on Facebook where it's an image of columns and rows of almost nothing but the number 529, and the challenge is to see if you can identify how many non-529 entries there are. 

I found myself scanning with my eyes, row after row, and then thinking to myself... 

"Rather than spend a few minutes and solve this with my eyes, why don't I spend waaaaaaay more time by:"

- opening the image in Photoshop
- noting the number of pixels between each column/row
- write a program to define each X/Y coordinate and use an image tool load/crop the image into sections (or "tiles") 
- use Optical Character Recognition (OCR) software to extrapolate text from the section

So that's what I did and got my computer to solve this stupid puzzle that's been plaguing my timeline.

Here's the answer:
